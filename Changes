Revision history for Perl extension Image::RGBA.

0.04  Sat Jan 04 2003
        - Moved files around so that make install actually does
          something

0.03  Fri Dec 29 2002
        - Changed the api so that pixels are now read/written with the
          Pixel() method, Sample() no longer exists.  An Image::Magick
          object can be retrieved at any time with Image().

0.02  Thu Oct 31 2002
        - Split into two modules; low level sampling in Image::RGBA
          and photo specific stuff in Image::Photo

0.01  Tue Sep 10 12:35:58 2002
	- original version; extracted kicking and screaming from
	  Image::Panorama
