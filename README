Image::RGBA Version 0.04
========================

Hides all the ugly stuff involved when sampling individual pixel values
from images.  A good range of quality levels are provided, currently;
simple, linear and spline16.

For an explanation of what is going on, see:

    http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/interpolator/interpolator.html

For usage, read the pod documentation, eg:

    perldoc Image::RGBA

Also provided is optional radial luminance correction - Suitable for
sampling photographs where there is a known light falloff from the
centre of the image to the edges.

Radial lens distortion can be corrected at the same time using a, b & c
parameters, see:

    http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/barrel/barrel.html

For usage, read the pod documentation, eg:

    perldoc Image::Photo

For typical applications, see the 'examples' folder.

ADVANTAGES

 - Inputs any file format supported by ImageMagick (png, jpg, tiff, pdf,
   bmp, mng, mpg, whatever).

 - Alpha channel information is sampled in the same way as Red, Green &
   Blue information.

 - Uses spline16 pixel interpolated sampling for high quality results.

 - Radial brightness and barrel distortion correction.  Independent of
   image orientation and brightness, so each camera should have one set
   of values that work in all situations.  

DISADVANTAGES

 - Since it works at a lower level than the Image::Magick Get() method,
   it's not quite as flexible.

BUGS

 - Probably.

TODO

 - Make faster (rewrite in C, contributions welcome).

 - Support 16 bit per pixel images.

INSTALLATION
